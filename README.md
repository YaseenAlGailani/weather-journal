## Project Description

Hi there!, this is simple app to Fetch data from OpenWeatherMap API, POST to it an  Express server along with user input and finally update the UI with fetched data from the Express server.

All code written is my own (feeling just a little bit proud of it "temporarily"!), if you caught any performance issues or have any suggestions I'll be more than happy to learn!

Cheers
